        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a junior Computer Science student at Towson University specializing in software engineering. Before college, I was focused on a career in music so a lot of my professional experience is from musical performances at the moment. My current goal is to get some projects built over this summer to start building a resume for internships.</p>
